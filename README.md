## Trying out

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Make a copy of the [.env.example](.env.example) file and rename it to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to put the API KEY from `openweathermap.org` into the value of the `API_KEY` variable.
You can use the `2f2175cde76061f6b76ede759837e776` key if you don't have the account.
